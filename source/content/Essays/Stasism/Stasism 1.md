AI tool to automatically highlight causes of major stock moves on the candle graph. I.e. correlate news with price changes. Analytics from this could be a valuable product?

Essay: there is a self-reinforcing "system" (a bit like patriarchy) preserving the status quo. Most obviously, status quo bias. Tall poppy syndrome. Also, regulations, fear of change and of failure (when innovating) (some parts of that are reasonable, see financial failure), a lack of drive to be or do better, 
We need to make it ok to try things (and fail). 


Is this novel??
Essay idea: there is no such thing as a new concept.
In a [podcast](https://api.substack.com/feed/podcast/159586076/d1f1228cbf08f0ea55931b0b89621f71.mp3?token=a8fcb067-5ab6-4b31-b21e-06c5413d78a2) I heard the suggestion that if you come up with something genuinely new, LLMs won't be able to understand it. This is false!
Fundamental laws of the universe are very simple. Vast complexity has developed from there by the input of randomness plus combinatorial flexibility/explosion, but at the root everything can be explained or decomposed into those fundamental laws. Therefore, every new idea is a composite/consequence of the fundamental laws.
Therefore all new ideas can be expressed as some combination of existing ideas.
Demo: if we know x=1 and y=2 then we know many things about functions involving X and y, but we know nothing about z. If someone then says z=3 then there are now *infinitely* many ways in which we can represent the relationship between x,y,z. Z is new but we can easily express it in terms of X and y.
X and y are already notes in the neural net. If you (or it) provide a novel idea z, it can represent it in terms of X and y. This is more computationally expensive than representing it directly, but that's only an implementation detail (a different NN could have a direct representation of z)


Yh says, in response to his work:consider how to award money using this info

Other stuff .. nominating someone to speak/more of us showing up to support on Sat? Unofficially I think Yung-Hsuan has kinda been nominated to present to the faculty, esp as Paulina and Simon are still away, but we def want to get some notes together for him

Headlines!
- This Friday midnight we should submit our award allocation and a 3000 word statement for the grantmaking exercise.
- ... and Saturday 10am we are to give a one hour presentation on the project.
- At 1pm on Sunday we have a Prototype Previews session.
- 6pm Tuesday evening is a "Product: Reverse Engineering" session.

Main to-do items:
- Finish the award allocations (work from [here](https://github.com/nwspk/political-awards-2025/blob/main/yh-doingstuff.ipynb)?)
- Finish the [report](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LmXEaatw-WUIwJVq4ez41MkC7NmtztseZcDvppPRsY8/edit?tab=t.0)
- Prepare the presentation
- If you're not getting involved in the grantmaking exercise, check the [kanban](https://planka-newspeak.jvuoh.xyz/) for things you can do, or close off if they're done/no longer needed.
