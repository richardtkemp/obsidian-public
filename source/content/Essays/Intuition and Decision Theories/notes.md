Separate topics here:
- instinct as evolved tdt
- how cdt became more dominant - pos effects
- modern problems seen as overuse of cdt
- how to cultivate tdt perspective, when not to
- spirituality as cultural tdt
- implications for .. other things? politics? spirituality? education?
- libertarianism as a reaction to individualism - it's actually going against our evolved instincts! A patch on a broken culture, by admitting defeat. Maybe it's a valid path - but denying one of the instincts which made us successful doesn't seem a priori like it would be the optimal path.
- Relevant instincts which we might criticise? Nepotism? Tribalism
- what would rational thought deployed toward mutual benefit look like? sounds like socialism but is it?
	- **Instinctive individualism** (early vertebrates, basic survival)
	- **Instinctive kin-group mutualism** (mammals, primates - Hamilton's rule)
	- **Instinctive tribal mutualism** (early humans - in-group cooperation, out-group competition)
	- **Explicit rational individualism** (default from Enlightenment onwards - market thinking, utilitarian calculus. Existed before, but was near-universally frowned on). NB some of our rational stuff is pro-coordination: writing, laws, religion, internet
	- **?? The next phase**

Mismatch between institutions and cognitive styles, as institutional patterns were created back in a more timeless time, when people cared about 'what kind of person are you' more than now. Institutions are now struggling to deal with a population which thinks in terms of 'what can I get'/'what are the direct effects of my actions'.
	There's definitely something here - also relates to how modern politics seems so unfit for purpose? And how almost any alternative system seems like it could be better: because you can reimagine from the ground up, including how it would work with modern people, rather than being stuck in a hundreds-years-out-of-date frame of how people are (which is ossified into our current institutional structures)

How do we transmit the causal perspective? School/culture? Maybe we should be more careful about the way we teach things in school, to try to form a foundation of timeless thinking before introducing strong causality.

Fdt explicitly tries to arrive at the "best" behaviour, ends up implementing the categorical imperative, a very intuition-friendly approach

Seems like there's a strong McGilchrist connection here - this is a very left/right brain divide.



System 1 vs 2
Right vs left brain

novel contribution is that the timeless connection
instinct is the set of stimulus+response which were selected for over time: they are evolutionarily optimal, within the ancestral env. what has changed since then?
(if instinct conflicts with rational decision making, either a) you're not actually being rational - missing information or not thinking deeply enough, b) the rational decision is good for you but bad for your genes (tribe), c) you're reasoning about an area to which instinct is badly suited)
env has changed a lot in some ways and very little in others

language allows us to construct complex arguments of cause and effect, extending causal reasoning's reach out beyond where it (bio) evolved to, and allowing us to lead ourselves astray with it sometimes.
Even if we construct a sound argument for why going against instinct is good, it's likely the argument is missing something which instinct does not miss (second/third/etc order effects). Instinct is not reasoned or designed, but it *is* battle-tested, often literally.


When to trust it? When the matter at hand it similar enough to the ancestral env.
