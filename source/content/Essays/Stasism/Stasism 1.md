There is a self-reinforcing "system" (a bit like patriarchy) preserving the status quo. Most obviously, status quo bias. Tall poppy syndrome. Also, regulations, fear of change and of failure (when innovating) (some parts of that are reasonable, see financial failure), a lack of drive to be or do better, 
We need to make it ok to try things (and fail).
