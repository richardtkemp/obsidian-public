NB 'Functional Decision Theory' exists and is superficially fairly similar to TDT, but performs better in some edge cases. I may sometimes refer to TDT because I like the name better and I don't think the difference between the two matters for my purposes. Imagine me writing instead about FDT if you prefer.
