# 0 Summary
Here is an incomplete list of categories into which we might sort 'instincts', and some examples:
- survival: eat, take shelter, fuck
- social: reciprocity, fairness
- cultural: follow norms, respect hierarchies
- aesthetic: babies are cute, flowers are beautiful
- learned/intuition: inexplicit knowledge gained from lots of experience in a particular domain

Below I will provide a theory of social and cultural instincts as [superrational](https://www.lesswrong.com/w/superrationality) algorithms implementing [functional decision theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.05060).


System 1 vs 2
Right vs left brain

novel contribution is that the timeless connnection
instinct is the set of stimulus+response which were selected for over time: they are evolutionarily optimal, within the ancestral env. what has changed since then?
(if instinct conflicts with rational decision making, either a) you're not actually being rational - missing information or not thinking deeply enough, b) the rational decision is good for you but bad for your genes (tribe), c) you're reasoning about an area to which instinct is badly suited)
env has changed a lot in some ways and very little in others

language allows us to construct complex arguments of cause and effect, extending causal reasoning's reach out beyond where it (bio) evolved to, and allowing us to lead ourselves astray with it sometimes.
Even if we construct a sound argument for why going against instinct is good, it's likely the argument is missing something which instinct does not miss (second/third/etc order effects). Instinct is not reasoned or designed, but it *is* battle-tested, often literally.
because everyone has roughly the same instincts, they serve as a guide which universalises actions across individuals, therefore having the opportunity to push individuals toward doing something which (appears)/is worse for them but is better for the collective (aka for their genes).
Taking actions which those like you would take is exactly TDT - instinct implements TDT.

When to trust it? When the matter at hand it similar enough to the ancestral env.
