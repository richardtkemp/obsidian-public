# 0 Summary
Here is an incomplete list of categories into which we might sort 'instincts', and some examples:
- survival: eat, take shelter, fuck
- social: reciprocity, fairness
- cultural: follow norms, respect hierarchies
- aesthetic: babies are cute, flowers are beautiful
- learned/intuition: inexplicit knowledge gained from lots of experience in a particular domain

Below I will provide a theory of interpersonal (social and cultural) instincts as [superrational](https://www.lesswrong.com/w/superrationality) algorithms implementing [functional decision theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.05060), an explanation of why we sometimes do not follow these instincts, and a corrective heuristic of when we should trust instinct vs when we should employ 'rational' thought.
# 1 Superrational instincts
Evolution does not optimise strictly for the success of the individual - it optimises for the success of the gene. This often means individual success, but can also mean the net success of the individual's kin and/or tribe at the expense of the individual. Most animals are individualistic, and we could call their behaviour rational* in that frame, though not explicitly so. Social creatures however must diverge from strict individualist rationality in order to prioritise the other over self at times. (NB even bacterial colonies cooperate I think?)

In our evolutionary history, we likely went from instinctive individualism, to instinctive kin-group mutualism (proto-social instincts), to instinctive tribal mutualism (tribal/proto-cultural instincts).
Here we see instinct as an evolved counter-balance to earlier individualist rational* instincts. Individualist creatures can be entirely 'rational' but in order to maintain a collective which is not exploited by individuals, a balancing pro-social instinct is required.

Because all humans have roughly the same instincts, they serve as a guide which universalises actions across individuals, therefore having the ability to push individuals toward doing something which either appears or is worse for them, but is better for the collective (aka for their genes).
Taking actions which those like you would take is exactly [[TDT]] - instinct implements TDT.

# 2 Rational individualism
Pre-enlightenment - sophists?
Enlightenment justifies rational individualism using (limited) logic.
Benefits of rational thinking are huge, make it look like an intellectual panacea -> overreach, arguing against instincts.
# 3 The domains of instinct and reason
Instinct for social/tribal situations, for things present in the ancestral env. Reason for novel things.
We reject nepotism and excess tribalism - why? How to justify using reason here? Is it because of the felt-sense of tribe membership? Drawing the boundary in a different place? Nepotists draw it more at the family level. Where then should we draw it?
