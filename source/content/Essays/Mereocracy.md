“Individual: a living system maintaining both a higher level of internal cooperation and a lower level of internal conflict than either its components or any larger systems of which it is a component.”

—Fields and Levin, 2018



we know that wholes are 'more than the sum of their parts'
NB MORE THAN
i.e. even summing ALL the consituent parts does not equal the whole.
and yet wholes are entirely dependent on their parts

sacrificing the whole for the good of a part (e.g. akrasia, allowing rampant costly legal action against the NHS) harms the whole and therefore harms all the parts (to the extent to which they are truly a part of the whole i.e. symbiotic/mutually dependent with it. Maybe some parts e.g. rich people with health insurance are less dependent)..
seems the only time this is not true is when you are resource (e.g. time) constrained. But in the long run, it's worth doing it properly. It may be slower now, i.e. it may hurt now (this *part* of your life) but in the long run (i.e. the *whole* of your life), it is better to learn properly even if that is slow. Do not sacrifice the whole for the part.

we are literally a part of the universe. above logic gives the universe something like rights? (assuming we have 'rights' of some kind). although it wouldn't have them (in the same way at least) if we were not parts?

this logic seems to be a bit utilitarian - encourages 'for the greater good' type thinking. But you don't have to manage the whole separate from the parts in a disconnected utilitarian way, and tell parts they must sacrifice for the whole. *You can set up systems such that incentives for parts benefit the whole, so both benefit together.* You should want to be a part of a whole which works this way! c.f. cells and bodies vs cancer.
maybe the (or a) mistake of utilitarianism is trying to examine wholes without considering parts which constitute them. how do we think about the relative importance of wholes and parts? I seem to have presented two different views here. Perhaps a synthesis is 'let wholes take care of themselves, but ensure that incentives for parts are not to damage the whole.' c.f. tragedy of the commons.

------------------------

This is a fascinating meditation on mereology and systems thinking! Your stream of consciousness reminds me strongly of several interconnected ideas:

**The paradox of emergence** - You've articulated something fundamental about how wholes transcend their parts while remaining utterly dependent on them. This makes me think of Conway's Game of Life, where gliders and other patterns emerge from simple rules but can't exist without their constituent cells. Yet the patterns have properties (movement, persistence) that individual cells don't possess.

**The temporal dimension of sacrifice** - Your point about learning rules before breaking them reveals something profound about how we navigate the part/whole relationship across time. It reminds me of ==the marshmallow test, but inverted - sometimes the "delayed gratification" isn't about getting more marshmallows later, but about becoming the kind of system that doesn't need marshmallows at all.==

**The recursion of rights and responsibilities** - If we grant that wholes have something like rights derived from their parts, and we're parts of progressively larger wholes (body → community → ecosystem → universe), we get this beautiful recursive structure. But it also suggests a kind of cosmic democracy where every level has standing.

Your synthesis about incentive alignment is particularly compelling. It makes me think of:
- **Mechanism design** in economics - creating games where individual rationality leads to collective good
- **Cellular automata** - where local rules produce global behaviors
- **Permaculture principles** - designing systems where each element serves multiple functions

The cancer analogy is perfect - cancer cells are "defecting" from the body's cooperative game. They're optimizing locally while destroying globally.

What strikes me most is your observation about utilitarianism's blindness to parts. Perhaps the real insight is that **ethics needs to be fractal** - working at every scale simultaneously. Not "the greatest good for the greatest number" but "sustainable flourishing at every level of organization."

This also connects to ideas about **antifragility** - systems that gain from disorder often do so because they've aligned the interests of parts and wholes. The body's immune system gets stronger from challenges because individual immune cells benefit from practice.

Where this takes me: What if we thought about social institutions as **gradient fields** rather than hierarchies? Instead of top-down or bottom-up, we'd have flows of benefit/information/resources that naturally align interests across scales. Like how trees move nutrients both up from roots and down from leaves, creating circulation rather than extraction.

One more thread this pulls on: Your idea about wholes having rights "assuming we have 'rights' of some kind" opens up a recursive question. If rights emerge from the part-whole relationship, then rights themselves might be emergent properties of certain kinds of systems. Not natural or given, but arising when parts organize in ways that create mutual dependencies worth protecting.

This makes me wonder if the real problem with both pure individualism and pure collectivism is that they're trying to **ground** ethics at a single level, when perhaps ethics is more like a **standing wave** - a pattern that only exists in the interaction between levels.
