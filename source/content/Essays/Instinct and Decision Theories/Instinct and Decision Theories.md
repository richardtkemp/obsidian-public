# 0 Summary
Here is an incomplete list of categories into which we might sort 'instincts', and some examples:
- survival: eat, take shelter, fuck
- social: reciprocity, fairness
- cultural: follow norms, respect hierarchies
- aesthetic: babies are cute, flowers are beautiful
- learned/intuition: inexplicit knowledge gained from lots of experience in a particular domain

Below I will provide a theory of interpersonal (social and cultural) instincts as [superrational](https://www.lesswrong.com/w/superrationality) algorithms implementing [functional decision theory](FDT.md), an explanation of why we sometimes do not follow these instincts, and a corrective heuristic of when we should trust instinct vs when we should employ 'rational' thought.
# 1 Superrational instincts
Evolution does not optimise strictly for the success of the individual - it optimises for the success of the gene. This often means individual success, but can also mean the net success of the individual's kin and/or tribe at the expense of the individual. Most animals are individualistic, and we could call their behaviour rational* in that frame, though not explicitly so. Social creatures however must diverge from strict individualist rationality in order to prioritise the other over self at times. (NB even bacterial colonies cooperate I think?)

In our evolutionary history, we likely went from instinctive individualism, to instinctive kin-group mutualism (proto-social instincts), to instinctive tribal mutualism (tribal/proto-cultural instincts).
Here we see instinct as an evolved counter-balance to earlier individualist rational* instincts. Individualist creatures can be entirely 'rational' but in order to maintain a collective which is not exploited by individuals, a balancing pro-social instinct is required.

Because all humans have roughly the same instincts, these instincts serve as a guide which universalises actions across individuals, therefore having the ability to push individuals toward doing something which either appears or is worse for them, but is better for the collective (aka for their genes).
Taking actions which those like you would take is exactly the outcome of [[FDT]] - i.e. interpersonal instincts are _Functions_ of Functional Decision Theory.
# 2 Rational individualism
Pre-enlightenment - sophists? Their focus on persuasion over truth is fundamentally individualist and was reviled by many of their contemporaries.
Enlightenment justifies rational individualism using (limited) logic of [[CDT]].

The benefits of rational thinking are huge (even for cooperation!), making it look like a problem-solving panacea. Writing, laws, religion, internet - what's not to like? The enormous and continuing success of rational thinking occludes it's flaws, leading to overreach when it is employed to naively argue against useful instincts.
# 3 The domains of instinct and reason
Instinct is the set of stimulus+response which were selected for over time: they are evolutionarily optimal, within the ancestral environment. What has changed since then?
Env has changed a lot in some ways and very little in others...

If interpersonal instincts conflict with rational decision making, either a) you're not actually being rational - missing information or not thinking deeply enough, b) the rational decision is good for you but bad for your genes (tribe), c) you are applying your instincts at the wrong 'level' (e.g. family vs nation), d) you're reasoning about an area to which interpersonal instincts are badly suited or irrelevant, like brain surgery or rocket science. 

>**Heuristic**: Use reason for novel things, and instinct for social/tribal situations, for things (similar enough to those) present in the ancestral environment. NB be sure to use the right group scale! Don't limit yourself to tribal.

# 4 Which collective exactly?
Our instincts developed to promote genetic proliferation within small-ish bands of humans (see Dunbar's number), and cultural innovation has developed memes to support the extension of our instincts to wider circles of concern. 

Hence we reject nepotism and excess tribalism - our memes say that our circle of concern should be wider than just kin/tribe. How to justify using reason in this isolated case? Is it because of the felt-sense of tribe membership? Drawing the boundary in a different place? Nepotists draw it more at the family level. Where then should we draw it? How can we tell, and how should we persuade others?

|Boundary at|Benefits|Costs|Historical emergence|Supporting memes|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Family|Intuitive, strong motivation, evolutionary aligned|Excludes beneficial cooperation with outsiders, limits innovation and specialization|~2 million years ago|"Blood is thicker than water", "Family first", "Honor thy father and mother"|
|Extended family/clan|Maintains kinship bonds, manageable group size|Clan-based corruption, limits social mobility, feuding between clans|~50,000 years ago|"Our bloodline", "Ancestral honor", "Clan loyalty", Scottish Highland culture|
|Local community|Builds social capital, manageable accountability, shared local knowledge|Parochialism, resistance to beneficial outsiders, NIMBY-ism|~10,000 years ago (agriculture)|"Community spirit", "Local pride", "Support local business", "Think globally, act locally"|
|Subculture/neo-tribe|Strong identity bonds, chosen affinity, cross-geographic cooperation|Echo chambers, ideological purity tests, hostility to outgroups|~1960s (modern form)|"Find your tribe", "Be authentic", "Community over competition", brand loyalty|
|Profession/class|Shared interests and expertise, career advancement|Professional cartels, class barriers, rent-seeking behavior|~Medieval guilds, modern ~1800s|"Professional standards", "Solidarity", "Class consciousness", "Professional courtesy"|
|Nation|Civic institutions, rule of law, large-scale coordination|Nationalism, exclusion of beneficial immigration, international conflict|~1648 (Westphalia), popularized 1800s|"Patriotism", "National interest", "One nation under God", "Make [country] great again"|
|Humanity|Universal cooperation, global public goods, peace|Tragedy of the commons, weak enforcement, free-rider problems|~1945 (UN), roots in Enlightenment|"Human rights", "We are one", "Global citizenship", "Think of the children"|
|All sentient beings|Reduces suffering across species, moral consistency|Extremely difficult trade-offs, competing needs across species|~1970s (animal rights movement)|"All creatures great and small", "Sentience matters", "Speciesism", "Compassion for all"|
|Future generations|Sustainable development, intergenerational justice|Present sacrifice for uncertain future benefit, temporal coordination problems|~1970s (environmentalism)|"For our children", "Seven generations", "Sustainable development", "Climate emergency"|
|Universal principles|Objective moral framework, consistency across contexts|Abstract and hard to implement, may conflict with survival instincts|~Ancient philosophy, modern ~1700s|"Do unto others", "Categorical imperative", "Justice is blind", "What would Jesus do?"|

It's interesting that the non-universal levels beyond 'nation' are relatively new, they are religion substitutes and/or not necessary when you have the higher/universal perspective of religion.
Perhaps there is no single best level, and we have to flexibly choose the right level of analysis for the problem we face.
NB This is starting to bear some resemblances to [[Mereocracy]].
