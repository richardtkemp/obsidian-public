Mismatch between institutions and cognitive styles, as institutional patterns were created back in a more timeless time, when people cared about 'what kind of person are you' more than now. Institutions are now struggling to deal with a population which thinks in terms of 'what can I get'/'what are the direct effects of my actions'.
	There's definitely something here - also relates to how modern politics seems so unfit for purpose? And how almost any alternative system seems like it could be better: because you can reimagine from the ground up, including how it would work with modern people, rather than being stuck in a hundreds-years-out-of-date frame of how people are (which is ossified into our current institutional structures)

How do we transmit the causal perspective? School/culture? Maybe we should be more careful about the way we teach things in school, to try to form a foundation of timeless thinking before introducing strong causality.

Fdt explicitly tries to arrive at the "best" behaviour, ends up implementing the categorical imperative, a very intuition-friendly approach
