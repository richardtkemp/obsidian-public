we know that wholes are 'more than the sum of their parts'
NB MORE THAN

i.e. even summing ALL the consituent parts does not equal the whole.

and yet wholes are entirely dependent on their parts

sacrificing the whole for the good of a part (e.g. akrasia, allowing rampant costly legal action against the NHS) harms the whole and therefore harms all the parts (to the extent to which they are truly a part of the whole i.e. symbiotic/mutually dependent with it. Maybe some parts e.g. rich people with health insurance are less dependent)

'learn the rules before you can break them'

seems the only time this is not true is when you are resource (e.g. time) constrained. But in the long run, it's worth doing it properly. It may be slower now, i.e. it may hurt now (this *part* of your life) but in the long run (i.e. the *whole* of your life), it is better to learn properly even if that is slow. Do not sacrifice the whole for the part.

we are literally a part of the universe. above logic gives the universe something like rights? (assuming we have 'rights' of some kind). although it wouldn't have them (in the same way at least) if we were not parts?

--

this logic seems to be a bit utilitarian - encourages 'for the greater good' type thinking. But you don't have to manage the whole separate from the parts in a disconnected utilitarian way, and tell parts they must sacrifice for the whole. *You can set up systems such that incentives for parts benefit the whole, so both benefit together.* You should want to be a part of a whole which works this way! c.f. cells and bodies vs cancer.

maybe the (or at least a) mistake of utilitarianism is trying to examine wholes without considering parts which constitute them. how do we think about the relative importance of wholes and parts? I seem to have presented two different views here. Perhaps a synthesis is 'let wholes take care of themselves, but ensure that incentives for parts are not to damage the whole.' c.f. tragedy of the commons.

alternatively, give wholes voice/rights, but ensure their parts also have sufficient voice/rights that they are not dominated by wholes.
